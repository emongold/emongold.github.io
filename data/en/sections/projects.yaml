  role: Author
  timeline: "December 2020 - June 2022"
  repo: https://github.com/bakerjw/GMMs # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
  #url: ""  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: I organized and validated Matlab functions for numerous ground motion models (GMMs), published in a report and GitHub repository. The report compares various functions and correlation models, documenting their use. Report available at https://purl.stanford.edu/qy113my5899.
